 # The Joint Data Project (GDP)
 
## About GDP

**GDP** is an initiative aimed at enabling the sharing of open and comparable data from Swedish funders of research and innovation by producing a common data standard. The project is the result of a government assignment and is run by the Swedish Energy Agency, Formas, Forte, the Swedish Research Council, and Vinnova. A project group with members from the funders collaborates with a reference group consisting of external data consumers to determine the content of the standard. A steering group appointed for the project has decided to adopt version 2.0 of the standard and begin sharing data accordingly. The ambition is to further develop the standard beyond version 2.0 and add new data to the data sharing.

## What does this repo contain?
This GitHub repository contains documentation of the standard according to version 2.0 in the form of:

- [Information model dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/e/68d24e0b7c85fb9961ec9252/68d259f97c85fb9961eedf69)
- [Information model dbdocs](https://dbdocs.io/rickard.franzen/GDP-version-2.0)
- [Technical specifications for API](https://github.com/Gemensamma-data-GDP/Dokumentation/blob/main/Tekniska%20specifikationer%20f%C3%B6r%20API/)

## Limitations

 - The GDP standard is technology-agnostic; the project does not aim to produce common technical solutions for data sharing.
 - The data covered by the standard is open data.
 - Each funder describes its own implementation of the standard and of the data quality.
